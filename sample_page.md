## Game Programs Tutorials

**Project description:** Basic directions on how to play games

### 1. Reaper Haunting

In Reaper Haunting, you play as a newly acquainted Grim Reaper after your successor has retired from centuries of reaping souls. Only just as the previous reaper retires, many vengeful souls take it as opportunity to leave their respective realms as you were given little to no training in your field. As the new appointed Angel of Death it is you job to reap Deviant souls and those whose time is nigh. In you journey you may also meet lost souls and those who are to be judged for banishment or reincarnation.
